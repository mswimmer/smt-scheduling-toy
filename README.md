# smt-scheduling-toy
A little toy scheduling tool using the [Z3](https://z3prover.github.io) SMT Solver as a basis for generating candidate 
shift schedules for the heralds in a conference. This was inspired by being a herald for the 
[34C3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) congress.
